# calender_generator

The program is about generating a calender based on a specific month and a year given by the user. 

The program asks user to enter the year and the month, and will show the calender based on month and the year that user selects.

The program will only allow the user to enter a valid month as an integer, for example {1: 'January', 2:'February'} etc, and will prompt the user to reenter a valid integer from 1 to 12. The calendar generates monthly calendars for any year greater than or equal to 1900. The user may enter a valid integer year greater than 1900 but not less than 1900. 

The program also takes into account leap years and displays the calendar month correctly. 

Each month has a default color using colorama library (Spring = Green, Summer = Yellow, Fall = Red, and Winter = Blue).
